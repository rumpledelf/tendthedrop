{{site.title}} offers an ongoing Drupal site maintenance service, complemented by optional site improvement services. Our service is best suited to large, complex Drupal sites where there are not enough in-house resources available to effectively perform maintenance. We are not a one-size-fits-all service, and we can organise a plan that suits your needs.

<a name="start"></a>

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Getting started</h2>

The first step will be for us to have a look at your Drupal site and evaluate its current status. The results of this initial site assessment will effect the steps we take to get set up. In general, the steps we will take are:

<ol>
	<li>Initial site assessment</li>
	<li>Move your code into version control if it is not already</li>
	<li>Set up an issue tracking system for you, or utilise your existing system</li>
	<li>Issues flagged in the initial site assessment will be added into the issue queue</li>
	<li>Move your site to a new host if required</li>
	<li>Set up additional services as required</li>
	<li>Apply any security updates flagged by the initial site assessment as a priority</li>
	<li>Move on with maintaining your site!</li>
</ol>

The additional services we offer are listed below:

<a name="hosting"></a>

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">24/7 Support</h2>

Drupal sites can consume large amounts of hosting resources, which can cause performance issues on hosting infrastructure that is not a good match for the resource needs of your site.

We can evaluate your current hosting situation and if required, we can arrange for your site to be moved to reliable, managed hosting at our partner host, <a href="http://www.anchor.com.au">Anchor Systems</a>. Founded in 2000, Anchor is a global provider of managed hosting services for business critical websites and web applications.

Anchor specialises in creating innovative and scalable hosting solutions for their customers, bringing deep DevOps & Systems Administration expertise that is unique in the hosting industry. With AWS management and OpenStack cloud infrastructure spanning three data centres in Australia and the USA, they can build a solution to meet your needs.

<a name="monitoring"></a>

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Monitoring</h2>

Drupal sites can sometimes run slowly, especially if there is increase in visitors. Sometimes they can have intermittent downtime that is not caused by your host and will not be covered in their uptime guarantee.

Monitoring at the application level can identify bottlenecks and other slow points within your site that may be causing you to lose customers. Monitoring will give us the extra information about how your site performs needed to allow us to gradually improve that performance, which can increase your search ranking and conversion rates.

Regardless of whether you choose application level monitoring as an option, we will monitor your site for outages and fix them as soon as posible when they are reported.

<a name="backups"></a>
<img src="/database.png" class="howitworksicon">

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Backups</h2>

Many sites are deployed with no backup schedule in place. This is generally not a problem until something bad happens, from a new content editor accidentally deleting all your content through to hardware failures on your host.

Backups are insurance against disasters. You hope you never need them, but in the event you do need them, you will regret not having a solid backup and disaster recovery strategy in place.

If you do not have a backup and recovery strategy on your current host, we can arrange to set one up for you. If you choose to move to our partner host Anchor, we can set up a backup strategy as part of your hosting plan.

<a name="marketing"></a>

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Digital marketing & analytics</h2>

Do you need more visitors or to raise your site's profile? We can tailor a digital marketing strategy for your Drupal site that will raise your site's visibility through a combination of social media campaigns and paid advertising.

To improve conversion of existing visitors we can help you take your existing analytics data from either Google or Adobe sources and use this data to understand what your visitors are really doing on your site. We then use that understanding to improve the user's experience on your site. If you do not already have analytics set up on your site, we can help you with that too.

<a name="billing"></a>

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Billing</h2>

As this is a new service, we are currently only offering payment intervals of quarterly, six monthly and annually, invoiced and paid in advance. Depending on the demand, we may offer automatic monthly payments in the future.

There will be an up-front cost for the site evaluation and initial setup that will vary depending on how many additional services you choose over and above the basic maintenance package.
