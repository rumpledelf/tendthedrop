{{site.title}} offers an ongoing Drupal site maintenance service, complemented by optional site improvement services. Our service is best suited to large, complex Drupal sites where there are not enough in-house resources available to effectively perform maintenance. We are not a one-size-fits-all service, and we can organise a plan that suits your needs.

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">The process</h2>

The first step will be for us to have a look at your Drupal site and evaluate its current status. The results of this initial site evaluation will affect the steps we take to get set up. There is a minimum site evaluation fee, and then an additional charge may be incurred if your site needs a lot of set-up work. The length of time it takes for the set-up phase depends on many things, including some that are not in our control such as obtaining access to your site's source code, hosting or domain information from third parties.

In general, the steps we will take are:

<ol>
	<li><h4>Initial site evaluation</h4>

		We take an in-depth look at your site to check its current status. We look at things like what version of Drupal you are running; how your site is configured; any external services you are using; and are there any custom modules or modified Drupal code. If you are using Google Analytics, we can look at your traffic levels and make recommendations on caching and hosting. At the end of this stage we will know how much extra work it will be to set your site up for maintainence.

	</li>
	<li><h4>Move your code into version control if it is not already</h4>

		While most sites are using a version control system like Git, not all are. If you are already using version control, at this point we set up access to your repository. If your repository is held by another development company that you no longer wish to work with, we will work with you to transfer the ownership.

	</li>
	<li><h4>Set up an issue tracking system for you, or utilise your existing system</h4>

		If you do not have any kind of formal issue tracking system such as Jira or issue tracking attached to your version control system, we will set one up for you. Otherwise this is a similar process to setting up access or transferring ownership of your code repository, and often access to both repository and issue tracking occur together.

		If you were not previously using an issue tracker, at this point you should enter any outstanding issues that you are tracking by other means (e.g. through an email chain, on a whiteboard or in a spreadsheet) into your new issue tracking system.

	</li>
	<li><h4>Issues flagged in the initial site assessment will be added into the issue queue</h4>

		Anything actionable that was found in the initial assessment will be added to the issue queue. These may include items such as outstanding Drupal security patches, performance issues, or obvious bugs.

	</li>
	<li><h4>Move your site to a new host if required</h4>

		<p>If you are not happy with your current hosting plan, we can help you move to a new host. We recommend <a href="http://anchor.com.au">Anchor Systems</a>, but you are free to choose any host that meets your requirements.</p>

		<p>If you are not changing host and you do not have a staging server, this is the point we will work with you to set up a staging server. It is strongly recommended that you do not make changes directly to your production website, and a staging server allows you to review any changes before they go live. There may be an additional cost incurred by your host for this.</p>

	</li>
	<li><h4>Apply any security updates and other critical issues flagged by the initial site assessment as a priority</h4>

		Before we do anything else, we deal with the important stuff! These will be tested on your staging site first, to make sure there is no loss of functionality on your production site.

	</li>
	<li><h4>Set up additional services as required</h4>

		If you have indicated that you want additional services such as a digital marketing strategy, we start organising these once the more pressing issues are dealt with.

	</li>

	<li><h4>Move on with maintaining your site!</h4>

		Once your site is set up to be maintained, just make sure you indicate which issues are your priority. You can follow the status of any tickets through your issue tracking system.

	</li>
