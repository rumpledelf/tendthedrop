{{site.title}} offers an ongoing Drupal site maintenance service, complemented by optional site improvement services. Our service is best suited to large, complex Drupal sites where there are not enough in-house resources available to effectively perform maintenance. We are not a one-size-fits-all service, and we can organise a plan that suits your needs.

<a name="start"></a>

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Getting started</h2>

The first step will be for us to have a look at your Drupal site and evaluate its current status. The results of this initial site assessment will effect the steps we take to get set up. In general, the steps we will take are:

<ol>
	<li>Initial site assessment</li>
	<li>Move your code into version control if it is not already</li>
	<li>Set up an issue tracking system for you, or utilise your existing system</li>
	<li>Issues flagged in the initial site assessment will be added into the issue queue</li>
	<li>Move your site to a new host if required</li>
	<li>Set up additional services as required</li>
	<li>Apply any security updates flagged by the initial site assessment as a priority</li>
	<li>Move on with maintaining your site!</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Hosting</h2>

Drupal sites can consume large amounts of hosting resources, which can cause performance issues on hosting infrastructure that is not a good match for the resource needs of your site.

We can evaluate your current hosting situation and if required, we can arrange for your site to be moved to reliable, managed hosting at our partner host, <a href="http://www.anchor.com.au">Anchor Systems</a>. Founded in 2000, Anchor is a global provider of managed hosting services for business critical websites and web applications.

Anchor specialises in creating innovative and scalable hosting solutions for their customers, bringing deep DevOps & Systems Administration expertise that is unique in the hosting industry.

<a name="monitoring"></a>

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Monitoring</h2>

Drupal sites can sometimes run slowly, especially if there is increase in visitors. Sometimes they can have intermittent downtime that is not caused by your host and will not be covered in their uptime guarantee.

Adding monitoring to your site will give extra information about how your site performs and allows us to gradually improve it, as well as alerting us to any downtime your site experiences.

<a name="backups"></a>

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Backups</h2>

Many sites are deployed with no backup schedule in place. This is generally not a problem until something bad happens, from a new content editor accidentally deleting all your content through to hardware failures on your host.

Backups are insurance against disasters. You hope you never need them, but in the event you do need them, you will regret not having a solid backup strategy in place.

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Digital marketing</h2>

Need more visitors? Need higher visibility? Want a higher conversion rate on your existing visitors? We can tailor a digital marketing strategy for your Drupal site.

<a name="billing"></a>

<h2 class="howitworkstitle">Billing</h2>

As this is a new service, we are currently only offering payment intervals of quarterly, six monthly and annually, invoiced and paid in advance. Depending on the demand, we may offer automatic monthly payments in the future.

There will be an up-front cost for the site evaluation and initial setup that will vary depending on how many additional services you choose over and above the basic maintenance package.
