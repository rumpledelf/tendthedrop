<a name="version"></a>
<h3>Does it matter what version my site is?</h3>

We'd strongly prefer to deal with Drupal 7 sites, but will consider Drupal 6 too. At this stage we are not offering a Drupal 8 maintainence service as {{site.title}} is aimed at older or legacy websites.

<a name="hours"></a>
<h3>Is this based on fixed hours per month?</h3>

Loosely, yes. You'll agree in advance to some number of hours per month, based on your requirements. If you use more than your allocated hours in a month you have a buffer of one month's worth of hours over the year you can borrow from. In general however, it is best that you space out your jobs and issues over the year to best make use of your plan.

If you find you are using more (or less) than your agreed number of hours per month, you can change to a different plan from your next billable month.

<a name="setup"></a>
<h3>Is there a setup fee?</h3>

There is an initial setup fee based on the amount of work required to bring your site up to a base state of maintainability. There is a minimum fee to evaluate your site and your needs and set up the required remote access. If your site is already in version control and not in urgent need of a new host or other major changes to workflow, we can get set up quicker, easier and cheaper.

<a name="billing"></a>
<h3>How do you bill?</h3>

As this is a new service, we are currently only offering payment intervals of quarterly, six monthly and annually, invoiced and paid in advance. Depending on the demand, we may offer automatic monthly payments in the future, or you can set up a regular bank transfer yourself.

You can pay by bank transfer, paypal, cheque or cash but we'd prefer bank transfer.

<a name="feature"></a>
<h3>What is the difference between maintenance and a large feature?</h3>

The length of time it takes. Maintenance and small feature requests can be completed in a timeframe measured in hours and can be completed within your allocated hours per month. Larger features have a timeframe measured in days, weeks or longer. We can handle these on a case by case basis if they are not too large, but they will be not included in your maintenance plan. If needed, we can refer you to an external Drupal development shop for new features that require a large amount of time and resources.

<a name="multiple"></a>
<h3>Is there a discount for multiple sites?</h3>

That really depends on the site. If you have a group of very similar sites that often have the same issues come up, or related sites that need infrequent tweaks, then it makes sense to bundle them together and we can discuss a combined rate.

If you have multiple large sites that are not alike and that require constant maintenance, there won't be much benefit in bundling them all in one plan. However, if you have a large portfolio with us, we can work something out.

<a name="overseas"></a>
<h3>What if I'm not in Australia?</h3>

That's fine, websites run 24/7 not just in business hours. However, expect some delays in responding to tickets due to the difference in time zone.

You can choose to be billed in Australian dollars, or your local currency to avoid a fluctuating bill due to foreign exchange rates.

<a name="refer"></a>
<h3>Do you have a referral program?</h3>

Yes, if you are a development agency or freelancer looking to clear your plate of legacy websites that aren't under active development, we'll pay you to take them off your hands. 

Conditions apply of course, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> for more information.
