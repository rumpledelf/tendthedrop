<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Does it matter what version my site is?</h3>

We'd strongly prefer to deal with Drupal 7 sites, but will consider Drupal 6 too.

<h3>Is this based on fixed hours per month?</h3>

Loosely, yes. You'll agree in advance to some number of hours per month. You can roll over or borrow from the previous or next month if necessary and there is always a little flexibility because we're nice. However, if you are consistently using more than your allocation of hours you will need to move to a higher plan.

<h3>What is the difference between maintenance and a large feature?</h3>

The length of time it takes. Maintenance and small feature requests can be completed in a timeframe measured in hours. Larger features have a timeframe measured in days, weeks or longer. We can handle these on a case by case basis if they are not too large, but they will be not included in your maintenance plan. If needed, we can refer you to an external Drupal development shop for new features that require a large amount of time and resources.

<h3>Is there a discount for multiple sites?</h3>

That really depends on the site. If you have a group of very similar sites that often have the same issues come up, or related sites that need infrequent tweaks, then it makes sense to bundle them together and we can discuss a combined rate.

If you have multiple large sites that are not alike and that require constant maintenance, there won't be much benefit in bundling them all in one plan. However, if you have a large portfolio with us, we can work something out.

<h3>So, you're running an orphanage there?</h3>

Well, yes, that's one way of looking at it.

If you smiled when you saw this question in the FAQ, you might be interested to know that we have a referral program, and we're also looking to hire freelancers in the Sydney area.
